Really simple node script to have a bot replace messages that have twitter links without the embed fix in them.
Made this because I was so fed up with random people in my server never doing the .fxtwitter fix to links

The script simply listens to messages and deletes ones that have the x.com link and reposts the content while tagging which user sent it with a fixed link

It looks like this, really basic nothing special going on.
